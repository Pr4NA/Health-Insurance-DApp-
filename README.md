# Health Insurrance DApp

A blockchain-based health insurance system where users can buy policies, pay monthly premiums, and submit claims — all fully on-chain. Claims are verified by authorized doctors, and payouts are automatically released by the smart contract. The system is transparent, tamper-proof, and removes the need for traditional intermediaries.
